# LabForce_RevLabs
We will do an exploratory analysis on RevLabs data.

Here are the hierarchy of the solution files present in the repo(zip):
- test\RevelioLabs.html : Please go to test folder and open Reveliolabs.html file. This file is in the form of RevelioLabs newsletter.
- RevelioLabs Assignment.pdf : This is a five page long report in which we tried to do a deep dive into the data and answer some of the questions that we had.
- Exploratory_01.ipynb : This is the jupyter notebook that we have done all our analysis in.
